Pizza Time: A delicious online experience. I designed and developed an e-commerce platform for this pizza restaurant, featuring an interactive menu with a variety of options including pizza, sushi, and pasta. Simplifying the online ordering process and providing a seamless user experience was the key goal of this project.

Live Version:

[Pizza Time](https://pizza-time-with-react.vercel.app/)

A e-commerce platform tailored for the gastronomy industry. I led end-to-end design and development, utilizing technologies like React Icons, React Router DOM, React Alice Carousel, Leaflet Maps, React Paginate, UUID, React Lazy Load, and Framer Motion.

üçï Dynamic Culinary Hub:
Fictional restaurant featuring an extensive menu including pizzas, sushi, and pasta. Used React components like Icons, Router, and Carousel for easy navigation and user interface.

üìç Spatial Awareness with Leaflet Maps:
Used Leaflet Maps API to provide geographical insights, enhancing user interaction and store location understanding.

üé® UI Efficiency via Pagination and Motion:
Employed React Paginate for user-friendly menu page division, optimizing exploration. Framer Motion added smooth animations, enhancing visual appeal and interaction.

üÜî Efficient Data Management:
UUID for unique ID generation ensures robust menu item and order identification. React Lazy Load optimizes image/component loading, boosting site performance.

üíæ Data Integrity with MySQL2 and PlanetScale:
Implemented MySQL2 for a reliable database backend, securing transactions and user data. PlanetScale ensures scalable MySQL database operations.

üõí Streamlined Ordering via Express.js:
Developed Express.js-based ordering system for smooth cart management, item addition/removal, and quantity updates.

üë§ Personalized User Interaction:
Enabled user registration, login, and profile management. Users modify and delete profiles, enhancing customization.

üìß Secure Communication via reCAPTCHA:
Integrated Google reCAPTCHA to verify contact form users, curbing spam and ensuring secure communication.

Pizza Time brings together delicious food and advanced technology, creating a user-friendly digital experience. It's where great food meets programming, letting users enjoy a convenient and satisfying culinary journey.

## Getting Started with Create React App <a id="gettingStarted"></a>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get started you need to:

1. Clone the project
2. npm install
3. Install listed dependencies
4. Use available scripts, like npm start

## Available Scripts <a id="scripts"></a>

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single-build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


## Database <a id="database"></a>
To use the registration functionality for your own project, you need to use your own database. You can use any SQL database you wish and you adapt it to this project. I am using [Planetscape](https://planetscale.com/) serverless MySQL database. To have your own database you need to register and set it up by provided keys. I recommend you to use their [documentation](https://planetscale.com/docs).

## Goals <a id="goals"></a>
The main goal of this project is to get better at React and experience what it's like to work on something that feels more like a real project. In the past, I've mostly worked on small pieces of code that didn't do much on their own. With this project, I want to step into different shoes ‚Äì not just as a coder, but as someone who's building something useful and someone who's going to use it. 


## User Story <a id="userStory"></a>

As a user, I want to be able to add items to cart even if I am not logged in/registered. When navigating to the menu page, I want to see menu items that have pictures, name, ingredients, pricing.
I want to be able to sort the menu by categories, as well as be able to find something specific by writing it in the search bar. I want to be able to add items to cart, indicate the amount or delete the items from the cart. In the cart section, I want to be able to see how much I have to pay total and have the possibility to navigate to payments. Before paying, I want to add a special request to my order, like, "no spicy, please".
