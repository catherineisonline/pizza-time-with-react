# Pizza Time

![Pizza Time preview](https://github.com/catherineisonline/pizza-time-with-react/blob/main/src/assets/images/project-preview.png?raw=true)

I designed and built a full-stack food ordering platform for the gastronomy industry using React, Express.js, and Turso (libSQL).

Live Version: [Pizza Time](https://pizza-time-with-react.vercel.app/)

- Dynamic UI: Features a fictional restaurant with pizzas, sushi, and pasta. Built with React Router, Carousels, and Framer Motion for smooth navigation and animations.

- Fast & Clean Browsing: Used React Paginate and Lazy Load for faster menu browsing and performance.

- Secure & Scalable: Managed user data and menu items with UUID and Turso (SQLite).

- Cart + Auth System: Express.js backend handles user login/register, profile updates, and reCAPTCHA-protected contact & registration form.

## Getting Started <a id="gettingStarted"></a>

To get started you need to:

1. Clone the project
2. pnpm install
3. Install listed dependencies
4. Use available scripts, like pnpm dev

## Instructions <a id="instructions"></a>

- When you fork or download the project install node modules using pnpm install and then any additional dependencies you don't have from <a id="dependencies">Dependencies</a> list

- Next, you need to create the file name .env located outside the src file

- I am using several variables:

1. .env (in the backend folder)

- TURSO_DB_URL, TURSO_DB_TOKEN - these variables contain information that will connect you to the Turso database. You can use the following [documentation](https://docs.turso.tech/sdk/ts/quickstart). If you use any other database you need to use the according information to connect to that database. The token can be created after registration.
  Note that the table for users in my case is named "users" and contains the following data: id | email | password | fullname | address | number.

2. .env for the frontend

- VITE_USERS_URL - this is a url for Node.js server. First, it's better to run it locally and only then switch to whatever you want. If you want to run the server locally the value of this variable should be http://localhost:3000/users. In this project I set up backend using Vercel. You can google "How to Deploy Your Node.js Backend Project to Vercel" and set up your own backend.
- VITE_CAPTCHA_URL - the same logic works for this backedn url which this time is used for captcha verification. Locally, the url value should be http://localhost:3000/verify-recaptcha.
- VITE_CAPTCHA_KEY & VITE_CAPTCHA_SECRET - both values can be found once you create an account for reCaptcha at https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/. Please use their documentation for better understanding.

Once you set up the variables, you can run the server on one port, if you use local server and the website on another port.

## Database <a id="database"></a>

To use the registration functionality for your own project, you need to use your own database. You can use any SQL database you wish and you adapt it to this project. I am using [Turso](https://turso.tech/) database. To have your own database you need to register and set it up by provided information. I recommend you to use their [documentation](https://docs.turso.tech/sdk/ts/quickstart).

## Goals <a id="goals"></a>

The main goal of this project is to get better at React and experience what it's like to work on something that feels more like a real project. In the past, I've mostly worked on small pieces of code that didn't do much on their own. With this project, I want to step into different shoes – not just as a coder, but as someone who's building something useful and someone who's going to use it.

## User Story <a id="userStory"></a>

As a user, I want to be able to add items to cart even if I am not logged in/registered. When navigating to the menu page, I want to see menu items that have pictures, name, ingredients, pricing.
I want to be able to sort the menu by categories, as well as be able to find something specific by writing it in the search bar. I want to be able to add items to cart, indicate the amount or delete the items from the cart. In the cart section, I want to be able to see how much I have to pay total and have the possibility to navigate to payments. Before paying, I want to add a special request to my order, like, "no spicy, please".

## Project Decisions <a id="projectD"></a>

- **React**: I chose React for learning purposes as my first JavaScript library. There wasn’t a specific technical requirement, but during my research, I found it very popular and beginner-friendly.
- **Framer Motion**: I enjoy using Framer Motion, especially with React, because it offers easy setup, good documentation, and impressive animation capabilities. The downside is that it’s not very lightweight, but as the project grew, I wanted to include it to keep learning.
- **CSS**: My go-to is always plain CSS because I believe that mastering CSS makes other libraries or preprocessors easier to learn. It also gives me more control while I’m learning and experimenting.
- **Turso**: Even though backend isn’t my specialty, I needed a fully functional website and wanted something easy to use without deep knowledge. Turso also provides an interface to view tables, making database interaction simpler.
